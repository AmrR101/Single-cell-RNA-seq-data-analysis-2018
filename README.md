# Outline
Single cell RNAseq analysis with R
 - Preprocessing: from raw sequence reads to expression matrix
 - overview of tools and R packages for scRNAseq data analysis
 - scRNAseq data quality control 
 - cluster analysis
    - removal of undesired sources of variation
    - variable gene detection
    - dimensionality reduction
    - clustering
 - cell type identification
   - using known markers
   - using automatic classification algorithms
